                        <p>I wanted to become a Pilot at first because of my love for flight and travel but I realized I was okay at Math but bad 
                            Physics which I do not know how it works since Physics is like a lot of Math.

                        <p>I always used Computers since I was a kid. Played a game called "Pokemoncrater" which is like a website 
                            game quite a while ago. Right now the game is no longer available but I played other games as well like 
                            Midtown Madness.

                        <p>After sometime, I finally decided to become a Data Scientist and trying to excel at what I do and
